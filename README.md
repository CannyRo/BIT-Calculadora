# BIT-Calculadora
Develop a simple calculator using html, css and javascript (introducing javascript)

Instructions from Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp with Bogota Institute of Technology and the Iberoamericana University https://bit.institute/ & https://www.ibero.edu.co/

You should develop with HTML, CSS and Javascript an application with 4 buttons (Sum, Substraction, Multiplication, Division) and 3 inputs. 2 of them to catch numbers and the third to show the result of operations according to the operator.

N.B.
I realized this exercise with only 1 input and a calculator which looks like of a real pocket calculator.

The look is inspired by this :

The JS file is not inspired with any tutorial but only with my own experience of use old pocket calculator.
I'm sure the code could be upgraded but like that it seems to be quite readable and easy to understand.
